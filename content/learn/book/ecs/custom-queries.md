Ever find yourself writing out the same dozen systems parameters, over and over? Fear not! **Custom Queries** are here to save you.

Now, let's write our very own custom query! We'll use some components defined earlier in [Entites Have Components](../entities-components#defining-components)

```rs
use bevy::prelude::*;
use bevy::ecs::query::{QueryData, QueryFilter};

#[derive(QueryData)]
struct CombatantQuery
    _marker: &'static Combatant,
    name: &'static Name,
    life: &'static Life,
    stats: &'static Stats,
    allegiance: &'static Allegiance,
    in_combat: Option<&'static InCombat>,
}
```

Unlike [`Query`](../systems-queries) arguments which are regular old references, in a custom query we write `&'static`. This is just a contrivance to avoid having to constantly write lifetime parameters on any system that uses the query. [Read more about why below.](#why-the-static)

Let's use it in a system:

```
/// print the Life stats of all combatants in combat
fn print_in_combat_life_stats(
  query: CombatantQuery, // isn't this so much better?
) {
  for combatant in query.iter() {
    // ...
  }
}
```

* steal from [bevy/examples/custom_query_param.rs](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/examples/ecs/custom_query_param.rs)
* recommend `duplicate` crate for impling for the ro and rw version of a custom query
* think of a good example
{% end %}

## Why the `&'static`?

Rewrite this into something more docs-y with examples and such. james.obrien on discord very helpfully explained it and this writer is too dumb to re-explain it: https://discordapp.com/channels/691052431525675048/749335865876021248/1236859745944600698

> Ah, in order to have a reference inside a struct in rust you need to either mark it as 'static or give it a lifetime. The  lifetime would have to then be a generic on the struct and you would have to add it everywhere you use it.
> This also applies recursively to the surround scope, if you were to add a lifetime generic to `WorldQuery` you would then need to either specify it in your system function definition as `'static` or supply another generic lifetime you would then have to add to the system etc. etc.
> In the end `&T` in a query type definition is only a marker to say "I want a reference to T here", the lifetime on the reference in the type is irrelevant as the lifetime is constrained by the borrow on the query
